DS-2002: Data Project 1 - Restaurant Data MartThis project demonstrates a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for a restaurant reservations business process.It builds a dimensional data mart (Star Schema) from four different source systems and provides SQL queries for analysis.Project Structuresetup_source_db.py: A one-time script to create and populate the source source_hr.db SQL database.etl_pipeline.py: The main ETL script that reads from all sources and builds the data mart.analysis_queries.sql: SQL queries to analyze the data in the final data mart.source_hr.db: The source relational (SQLite) database (simulating an HR system).tables.csv: Source file (simulating a local file system) containing table information.reservations_log.json: Source file (simulating a NoSQL/document log) containing reservation transactions.restaurant_mart.db: The final destination data mart (OLAP) database.Data Sources (Meeting Rubric Requirements)Relational Database: source_hr.db (a SQLite file) provides employee data.File System (CSV): tables.csv provides restaurant table layout.File System (JSON): reservations_log.json provides the log of reservations.API: https://randomuser.me/api/ provides a list of registered customers.Schema: Star SchemaThe final restaurant_mart.db uses a star schema:Fact Table: FactReservationsDimension Tables:DimDate (time)DimCustomer (diner)DimTable (location)DimEmployee (staff member who took the reservation)How to RunInstall Dependencies:pip install pandas requests
Create the Source SQL Database:Run this script one time to create the source_hr.db file.python setup_source_db.py
Run the ETL Pipeline:This script will read from all 4 sources and build/rebuild the restaurant_mart.db.python etl_pipeline.py
Analyze the Data:Open the restaurant_mart.db file using a SQLite viewer (like the VS Code extension) and run the queries in analysis_queries.sql.
